I'm Abdulrahman, a junior full stack developer who spends my time working on full stack applications for [@umich](https://github.com/umich). In my free time, I enjoy learning, building software, and exploring different libraries and frameworks. Feel free to stay a while, and check out some of my projects and sandbox work ðŸ˜‡
