**Hey there!** 

I'm Abdulrahman, a junior full stack developer who spends my time working on full stack applications for [@umich](https://github.com/umich). In my free time, I enjoy learning, building software, and exploring different libraries and frameworks. Feel free to stay a while, and check out some of my projects and sandbox work ðŸ˜‡

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [friend.ly](https://github.com/abdultolba/social-mern), a social networking platform built on the [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) stack.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: TypeScript & Rust
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdultolba), [email](mailto:abdultolba@gmail.com) (preferred), or fill out the contact form on my [website](https://abdultolba.dev)!
- ðŸ”‰ Fun fact: My first experience with software development was on [neopets](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml), which is the reason I am a software engineer today ðŸ¥³
